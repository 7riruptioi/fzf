One of his most acclaimed novels is *Romanul adolescentului miop* (The Novel of the Nearsighted Adolescent), which he wrote between 1925 and 1927, when he was still a high school student. The novel is a semi-autobiographical account of his adolescence, marked by his passion for literature, philosophy, and mysticism. The protagonist, Mircea, is a nearsighted teenager who dreams of becoming a famous writer and being recognized by an "Academy from the West". He fills hundreds of pages with his experiences and reflections, while struggling with his insecurities, desires, and conflicts.
 
The novel is a remarkable example of Eliade's literary talent and creativity. He uses various techniques such as stream of consciousness, irony, humor, and intertextuality to create a vivid and original portrait of his generation and his inner world. The novel also reveals Eliade's profound knowledge of various cultural and spiritual traditions, such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity, Hermeticism, and Freemasonry. The novel is a rich source of insights into Eliade's personal and intellectual development, as well as into the cultural and historical context of interwar Romania.
 
The novel was first published in 1989, three years after Eliade's death. It has been translated into several languages and has received critical acclaim from both scholars and readers. It is considered one of the masterpieces of Romanian literature and one of the most influential works of modern European literature.

Mircea Eliade's novels are not only expressions of his artistic imagination, but also reflections of his scholarly interests and discoveries. He often used his fictional characters and stories as vehicles for exploring and illustrating his theories and concepts about the nature and function of religion, myth, and symbolism. He also drew inspiration from his own experiences and travels, especially his stay in India, where he studied Sanskrit and Hindu philosophy.
 
Some of his most famous novels are *Maitreyi* (Bengal Nights), *Isabel si apele diavolului* (Isabel and the Devil's Waters), *Noaptea de Sanziene* (The Forbidden Forest), *La tiganci* (With the Gypsy Girls), and *Pe strada Mantuleasa* (On Mantuleasa Street). These novels explore themes such as love, death, initiation, memory, identity, and the sacred. They also show Eliade's fascination with the exotic, the fantastic, and the miraculous. Eliade's novels are characterized by a complex and sophisticated style, rich in symbolism, metaphors, and allusions. They often challenge the conventional boundaries between reality and fiction, history and myth, logic and paradox.
