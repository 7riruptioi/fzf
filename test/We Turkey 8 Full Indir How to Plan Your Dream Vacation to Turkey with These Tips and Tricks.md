The 2005â06 season of the Turkish SÃ¼per Lig was one of the most thrilling and dramatic seasons in the history of Turkish football. The season saw a fierce title race between Galatasaray and FenerbahÃ§e, who were neck and neck until the final day of the season. Both teams finished with 81 points, but Galatasaray had a better goal difference by one goal and clinched their 16th league title. The season also saw some remarkable individual performances, such as GÃ¶khan Ãnal's 25 goals that made him the top scorer of the league, Alex de Souza's 19 goals and 15 assists that earned him the player of the year award, and Sergen YalÃ§Ä±n's comeback from retirement to lead BeÅiktaÅ to a third-place finish.
