To record your own vocals and whistle, follow these steps:

- Open Audacity and import the vocal track that you exported in Step 1 by clicking on File > Import > Audio.
- Click on Edit > Preferences > Devices. Under Recording, choose your microphone as the input device and make sure that Mono is selected as the number of channels. Click OK.
- Click on Transport > Transport Options > Overdub (on/off). This will allow you to record over the existing track.
- Click on Record (the red button) and start singing or whistling along with the original vocals. Try to match the pitch and timing as closely as possible.
- When you are done, click on Stop (the yellow button).
- You should see a new track below the original vocal track with your recording. You can play back both tracks together and listen how they sound.
