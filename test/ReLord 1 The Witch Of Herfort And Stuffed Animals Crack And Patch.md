The story of Re;Lord 1 ~The witch of Herfort and stuffed animals~ is set in a fantasy world where magic exists and demons live among humans. Wilfried is the son of the governor of Groessen, a region of Saarland that has been occupied by the Witches of Ruin.

Wilfried decides to lead a resistance army to liberate Groessen and restore his people's dignity.
 
Re;Lord 1 ~The witch of Herfort and stuffed animals~ is a game that combines RPG elements with humor and fanservice. It is a game for mature audiences who enjoy fantasy settings, strip battles, and cute characters. The game is available on Steam[^1^] and GOG[^2^] for Windows PC.

The gameplay of Re;Lord 1 ~The witch of Herfort and stuffed animals~ consists of two main modes: the world map and the strip battles. On the world map, Wilfried can move around and interact with various objects and characters. He can also use blocks to change the terrain and access new areas. Some blocks have special effects, such as healing, boosting stats, or triggering events. Wilfried can also find items and allies on the world map that can help him in his quest.
 
The strip battles are triggered when Wilfried encounters a witch or a boss. In these battles, Wilfried can use his sorcery skills to attack the enemy and remove their clothes. The more clothes he removes, the more damage he deals and the more vulnerable the enemy becomes. Wilfried can also use items and allies to assist him in battle. The battles are timed, and Wilfried has to defeat the enemy before the time runs out or he loses. The battles are also affected by the elements of wind and fire, which can change the effectiveness of Wilfried's skills.
