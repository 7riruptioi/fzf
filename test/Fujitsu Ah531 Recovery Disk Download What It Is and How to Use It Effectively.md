# How to Create and Use a Recovery Disk for Fujitsu Ah531 Laptop
 
If you own a Fujitsu Ah531 laptop, you may want to create a recovery disk that can help you troubleshoot and fix problems with your PC, even if it won't start. A recovery disk is a USB hard disk or flash drive that contains a copy of your system image, which is the configuration of your C: drive at a particular point of time. You can use the recovery disk to restore your system to its original state or to a previous backup image.
 
In this article, we will show you how to create and use a recovery disk for your Fujitsu Ah531 laptop. Please note that you will need a USB drive with enough capacity to store the system image, and that everything on the drive will be deleted during the process. You will also need to back up your personal files before proceeding with recovery, as Fujitsu is not liable for any data loss.
