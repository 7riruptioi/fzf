In this article, I will give you a brief overview of each song from *All The Little Lights*, as well as some of my personal opinions and insights. Here we go:
 
1. **Things That Stop You Dreaming**: This is the opening track of the album, and it sets the tone for the rest of the songs. It is a positive and uplifting song that encourages listeners to pursue their dreams and not let anything stop them. Passenger sings about how he has faced many difficulties and disappointments in his life, but he still keeps on dreaming and living. He also acknowledges that everyone has their own problems and fears, but he urges them to not give up on their hopes and aspirations. I like this song because it is very relatable and inspiring, and it reminds me to be grateful for what I have and to chase after what I want.
2. **Let Her Go**: This is the most famous and successful song from the album, and for a good reason. It is a beautiful and heartbreaking song that tells the story of a man who realizes that he has lost the love of his life, and he regrets not appreciating her when he had her. He reflects on how he only knows how much he loves her when he lets her go, and how he misses everything about her. He also wonders if she is happier without him, and if she has found someone else. The song is very catchy and emotional, and it resonates with anyone who has ever experienced a painful breakup or separation. I think this song is a masterpiece, and it showcases Passenger's talent as a songwriter and a singer.
3. **Staring at the Stars**: This is a mellow and soothing song that talks about how people can find comfort and joy in simple things, such as staring at the stars. Passenger sings about how he likes to look at the night sky and imagine different scenarios and stories, such as being an astronaut or a pirate. He also says that staring at the stars makes him feel connected to the universe and to other people who are doing the same thing. He invites listeners to join him in this activity, and to forget about their worries and troubles for a while. I like this song because it is very relaxing and whimsical, and it makes me feel calm and happy.
4. **All The Little Lights**: This is the title track of the album, and it is one of my favorites. It is a lively and upbeat song that celebrates the diversity and beauty of life. Passenger sings about how there are many different kinds of people in the world, each with their own stories, dreams, passions, flaws and secrets. He compares them to little lights that shine in the dark, creating a colorful and dazzling spectacle. He also says that he loves all these little lights, even if they are sometimes hard to see or understand. He encourages listeners to appreciate all the little lights in their lives, and to be one themselves. I like this song because it is very fun and catchy, and it makes me feel optimistic and cheerful.
5. **The Wrong Direction**: This is a humorous and sarcastic song that criticizes some aspects of modern society, such as consumerism, materialism, superficiality, conformity and hypocrisy. Passenger sings about how he feels like he is going in the wrong direction in life, because he does not fit in with the norms and expectations of others. He mocks how people are obsessed with money, fame, fashion, technology, trends and opinions, while neglecting more important things like happiness, love, meaning and authenticity. He also questions why people are so judgmental and intolerant of others who are different from them. He concludes that maybe he is not going in the wrong direction after all, but rather in his own direction. I like this song because it is very witty and clever, and it makes me think about what really matters in life.
