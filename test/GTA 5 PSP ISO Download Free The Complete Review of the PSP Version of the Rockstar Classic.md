GTA 5 is one of the most popular and successful games ever created by Rockstar Games. It is an open-world action-adventure game that lets you explore the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas, as well as take part in various missions, activities, and heists. GTA 5 was originally released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, and later for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC in 2014 and 2015. But what if you want to play GTA 5 on your PSP?
 
Unfortunately, there is no official version of GTA 5 for PSP, as the handheld console is too old and weak to run such a demanding game. However, there are some unofficial ways to enjoy GTA 5 on your PSP, using emulators or modified versions of the game. In this article, we will show you how to download and play GTA 5 on PSP for free, using two different methods: PPSSPP emulator and GTA 5 PSP ISO.

## Method 1: PPSSPP Emulator
 
PPSSPP is a free and open-source emulator that allows you to play PSP games on your Android, iOS, Windows, Linux, or Mac devices. It supports a large number of PSP games, including some popular titles like God of War, Tekken, Final Fantasy, and more. PPSSPP also has some features that enhance the gaming experience, such as high-resolution graphics, save states, cheats, and online multiplayer.
 
One of the games that PPSSPP can run is GTA 5 PSP ISO, which is a modified version of GTA 5 that has been compressed and adapted to work on PSP. GTA 5 PSP ISO is not an official product of Rockstar Games, but rather a fan-made project that aims to recreate the GTA 5 experience on PSP. However, it is not a perfect replica of the original game, as it has some limitations and differences in terms of graphics, gameplay, features, and content.
 
To download and play GTA 5 on PSP using PPSSPP emulator, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download PPSSPP emulator from its official website or from Google Play Store or App Store.
2. Download GTA 5 PSP ISO from a reliable source (such as [NairaTechs](https://www.nairatechs.com/2021/11/gta-5-ppsspp-gta-v-psp-iso-download-html/) or [Certified Gamer Games](https://certified-gamergames.blogspot.com/2022/10/gta-5-psp.html)) and extract it using a file manager or a zip extractor app.
3. Copy the extracted GTA 5 PSP ISO file to your device's storage (preferably in a folder named "PSP/GAME").
4. Launch PPSSPP emulator and navigate to the folder where you copied the GTA 5 PSP ISO file.
5. Select the GTA 5 PSP ISO file and tap on it to start playing.

## Method 2: GTA 5 PSP ISO
 
If you don't want to use an emulator to play GTA 5 on your PSP, you can also try downloading GTA 5 PSP ISO directly to your PSP device. This method requires you to have a custom firmware (CFW) installed on your PSP, which allows you to run homebrew applications and games that are not officially supported by Sony. CFW also gives you access to various features and options that are not available on the official firmware.
