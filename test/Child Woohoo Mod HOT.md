The Sims 4 is a life simulation game that allows players to create and control virtual characters, or Sims, and explore various aspects of their lives. One of the most popular features of the game is the ability to form romantic relationships with other Sims, which can lead to marriage, pregnancy, and woohoo (the game's euphemism for sex).
 
However, some players may feel that the game's romance options are too limited, especially for children and teens. By default, children can only have platonic interactions with other Sims, such as hugging, playing, or chatting. Teens can have crushes, kiss, and go on dates, but they cannot get married or pregnant. Moreover, the game does not allow any romantic or woohoo interactions between Sims of different age groups, such as adults and teens.
