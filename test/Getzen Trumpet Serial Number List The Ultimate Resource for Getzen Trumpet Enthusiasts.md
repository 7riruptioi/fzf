## A Brief History of Getzen Trumpets
 
Getzen is a family-owned company that has been making brass instruments since 1939. The founder, T.J. Getzen, was a former plant superintendent for the Holton Company and started his own business as a repair shop in a converted dairy barn in Elkhorn, Wisconsin. After World War II, he began to produce trombones, followed by trumpets and cornets in 1947. His son, J. Robert Getzen, became the plant superintendent in 1949 and later left the company to start his own business, Allied Music Corporation, in 1959.
 
In 1960, T.J. Getzen sold the company to Harold M. Knowlton, a Milwaukee attorney who moved the factory to a new location and expanded the product line to include professional trumpets, cornets, and flugelhorns. With the help of famous musicians like Carl "Doc" Severinsen, the Getzen Company developed a reputation for high-quality instruments that appealed to both students and professionals. The company suffered a setback in 1963 when a fire destroyed most of the factory, but it quickly recovered and resumed production in 1964.
 
In 1985, Knowlton sold the company to Charles F. Andrews, who ran into financial difficulties and lost control of the company in bankruptcy in 1991. The Getzen brothers, Thomas and Edward, who owned Allied Music Corporation and Edwards Trombones respectively, bought the assets of the Getzen Company and revived the family business. They continued to produce trumpets under the Getzen brand name, as well as trombones under the Edwards brand name. They also introduced new models and innovations, such as the Thayer valve and the Custom Series line of trumpets.
 
Today, Getzen is still a family-owned and operated company that strives to maintain its tradition of excellence and innovation. It offers a wide range of trumpets for different levels and styles of playing, from student models like the 300/400 Series to professional models like the Eterna Severinsen and Custom Series. Getzen trumpets are known for their durability, playability, and sound quality.
