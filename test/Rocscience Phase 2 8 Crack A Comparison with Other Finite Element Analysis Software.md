Rocscience Phase 2 8 is a powerful software for 2D geotechnical finite element analysis. It can be used to model various geostructures such as embankments, foundations, tunnels, excavations, dams, slopes, and more. In this article, we will show you how to use Rocscience Phase 2 8 for some common applications and features.
 
## Embankment Consolidation
 
One of the applications of Rocscience Phase 2 8 is to analyze the consolidation of embankments under different loading and drainage conditions. You can use the software to model the soil layers, boundary conditions, loading stages, pore pressure distribution, settlement, and stress-strain behaviour. You can also compare the results with analytical solutions or field measurements.

To perform an embankment consolidation analysis in Rocscience Phase 2 8, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Create a new project and define the geometry of the embankment and the soil layers.
2. Assign material properties and constitutive models to each soil layer. You can choose from various models such as Mohr-Coulomb, Cam-Clay, NorSand, etc.
3. Define the boundary conditions and initial stresses. You can specify fixed or free boundaries, initial pore pressures, water table level, etc.
4. Define the loading stages and time steps. You can apply different types of loads such as surcharge, strip load, point load, etc. You can also specify the duration and rate of loading and unloading.
5. Run the analysis and view the results. You can plot various output parameters such as displacement, pore pressure, effective stress, strain, etc. You can also export the results to Excel or other formats.

## Thermal Module
 
Another feature of Rocscience Phase 2 8 is the thermal module, which allows you to run thermal analysis on all types of geostructures. You can use this module to study the effects of temperature changes on the behaviour of geostructures such as permafrost thawing, soil freezing and thawing, thermal design of foundations, etc.
 
To perform a thermal analysis in Rocscience Phase 2 8, you need to follow these steps:

1. Create a new project and define the geometry of the geostructure and the soil layers.
2. Assign material properties and constitutive models to each soil layer. You also need to assign thermal properties such as thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, latent heat of fusion, etc.
3. Define the boundary conditions and initial temperatures. You can specify fixed or free boundaries, heat fluxes, heat sources or sinks, etc.
4. Define the climate input function. You can account for various climatic factors such as air temperature, wind speed, snow depth, solar radiation, earth emissions, evaporation rate, etc.
5. Run the analysis and view the results. You can plot various output parameters such as temperature distribution, heat fluxes, phase change zones, etc. You can also export the results to Excel or other formats.
