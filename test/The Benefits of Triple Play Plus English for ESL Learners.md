Are you looking for a fun and effective way to improve your English skills? Do you want to practice reading, listening, and speaking with interactive games and activities? If so, you might want to check out Triple Play Plus! English, a CD-ROM software that offers a variety of learning options for ESL learners of all ages and levels.
 
Triple Play Plus! English is a colorful, varied multimedia language tool designed for learners of English as a second or foreign language, ages 8 to adult. It has games for beginning and intermediate learners, in six subject areas: food, numbers, home and office, people and clothing, places and transportation, and daily activities. The games range from simple drill-and-practice vocabulary exercises, such as bingo and jigsaw puzzles, to more complex and creative activities, such as comic-strip conversations and speech recognition.

The software allows learners to practice reading, aural comprehension, and speaking skills. They can choose from three modes: aural comprehension, reading, or speaking. In the aural comprehension mode, they can listen to native speakers and answer questions or complete tasks based on what they hear. In the reading mode, they can read texts and answer questions or complete tasks based on what they read. In the speaking mode, they can use the microphone to record their voices and play them back, or to speak the answer to a question or part of a conversation into the microphone and get feedback from the software.
 
One of the most innovative features of Triple Play Plus! English is the automatic speech recognition technology. This feature allows the software to evaluate the learner's pronunciation and fluency and provide immediate feedback. The learner can also compare his or her voice with the native speaker's voice and improve their accent and intonation. The speech recognition feature is especially useful for learners who do not have many opportunities to practice speaking with native speakers or teachers.
 
Triple Play Plus! English is easy to install and use. It comes with a CD-ROM and a microphone. The CD-ROM must be in the CD-ROM drive to run the software. The software can also be run directly from the CD-ROM, but it will be slower. The software is compatible with Windows 3.1 or higher. The learner can adjust the volume settings on the machine and plug in the microphone. The software has clear instructions and help menus for each game and activity.
