Pop rock music is a genre that combines mainstream pop music with rock music, often featuring guitars and drums[^1^]. It is a hybrid of pop and rock that uses catchy pop style with light lyrics over guitar- or piano-based songs[^2^]. The genre has its roots in the traditions of rock 'n' roll pioneers like Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and the Beatles[^1^].
 
Pop rock music emerged in the late 1950s as an alternative to normal rock and roll, which was seen as too rebellious and aggressive by some audiences. Pop rock artists aimed to appeal to a wider and more diverse market, by incorporating elements of doo-wop, folk, country, and R&B into their songs[^1^]. Some of the early pop rock hits include "That'll Be the Day" by Buddy Holly, "Peggy Sue" by the Everly Brothers, "All Shook Up" by Elvis Presley, and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" by the Beatles.
 
Pop rock music reached its peak of popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, with bands and artists such as the Beach Boys, the Monkees, the Byrds, the Hollies, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Billy Joel, Rod Stewart, and Queen. These acts blended pop melodies and harmonies with rock instrumentation and energy, creating songs that were catchy, upbeat, and accessible. Some of the subgenres of pop rock that emerged during this period include power pop, jangle pop, soft rock, glam rock, and bubblegum pop.
 
Pop rock music continued to evolve and diversify in the 1980s and 1990s, with influences from new wave, synth-pop, punk rock, alternative rock, grunge, metal, and hip-hop. Some of the notable pop rock artists of this era include U2, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Bryan Adams, Roxette, REM, Oasis, Green Day, Nirvana, and No Doubt. These acts experimented with different sounds and styles while maintaining their pop sensibilities and mass appeal.
