One of the most useful features of Acrylic Wifi Pro is its ability to perform passive and active WiFi scans. A passive scan listens to the WiFi traffic and collects information about the networks and devices without sending any packets. A passive scan is fast, discreet, and does not affect the WiFi performance. An active scan sends probe requests to the networks and devices and collects more detailed information, such as the network name (SSID), encryption type, vendor, and MAC address. An active scan is slower, more noticeable, and may affect the WiFi performance.
 
Another feature of Acrylic Wifi Pro is its WiFi channel analyzer. This feature helps you find the best channel and frequency for your WiFi network, based on the signal quality, interference level, and network usage. You can view the channel distribution and occupancy of each frequency band (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) and see which channels are free, busy, or overlapping. You can also see the signal strength and quality of each network on each channel. By choosing the optimal channel and frequency for your WiFi network, you can improve its performance and stability.
 
Acrylic Wifi Pro also has a WiFi network monitor that allows you to track the status and performance of your WiFi network over time. You can see various metrics, such as the number of connected devices, the bandwidth usage, the signal quality, the packet loss, the retransmissions, and the latency. You can also set alerts and notifications for any changes or issues in your WiFi network. You can export all the data to CSV or PCAP files for further analysis or reporting.
