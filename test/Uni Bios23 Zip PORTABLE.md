# How to Use Uni Bios23 Zip for NeoGeo Emulation
 
Uni Bios23 Zip is a file that contains the UNIVERSE BIOS, a homebrew project that enhances the experience of playing on NeoGeo hardware. The UNIVERSE BIOS allows you to access features such as region selection, cheats, debug mode, memory card management, and more. It also supports MVS, AES, and CD systems. In this article, we will show you how to use Uni Bios23 Zip for NeoGeo emulation on your PC.
 
## Step 1: Download Uni Bios23 Zip
 
You can download Uni Bios23 Zip from the official UNIVERSE BIOS homepage[^1^]. The file name is uni-bios23.zip and it contains two files: uni-bios23.rom and neodebug.rom. You will need both files for the emulation.

## Step 2: Download a NeoGeo Emulator
 
There are many NeoGeo emulators available for PC, such as MAME, FinalBurn Alpha, Kawaks, Nebula, etc. You can choose any emulator that supports UNIVERSE BIOS. For this example, we will use MAME, which you can download from [https://www.mamedev.org/](https://www.mamedev.org/).
 
## Step 3: Copy Uni Bios23 Zip Files to the Emulator Folder
 
After downloading MAME and Uni Bios23 Zip, you need to copy the two files from Uni Bios23 Zip (uni-bios23.rom and neodebug.rom) to the emulator folder. The emulator folder is where you installed MAME on your PC. For example, if you installed MAME in C:\MAME, then you need to copy the files to C:\MAME.
 
## Step 4: Run the Emulator and Select a NeoGeo Game
 
Now you can run MAME and select a NeoGeo game from the list of available games. You can use the arrow keys and Enter to navigate the menu. You can also use the mouse to click on the game name.
 
## Step 5: Access the UNIVERSE BIOS Menu
 
Before starting the game, you need to access the UNIVERSE BIOS menu to configure some settings. To do this, press F2 on your keyboard. This will bring up a blue screen with several options. You can use the arrow keys and Enter to select an option.
