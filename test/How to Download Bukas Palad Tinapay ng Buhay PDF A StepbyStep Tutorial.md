Bukas Palad Music Ministry was founded in 1986 by Norman Agatep, Jandi Arboleda, and Rev Fr. Manoling Francisco SJ, who began writing liturgical songs as high school students [^1^]. They were inspired by the music of other Filipino composers such as Fr. Eduardo Hontiveros SJ, Fr. Carlo Magno Marcelo, and Fr. Nemy Que SJ, who pioneered the use of Filipino language and indigenous musical forms in Catholic worship . Bukas Palad means "generous" or "open palm" in Filipino, and it reflects the group's vision of sharing their God-given talents with others.
 
Bukas Palad Music Ministry is composed of young professionals and students who volunteer their time and talents for the service of the Church. They are also active members of various parish communities and church organizations. The group is affiliated with the Jesuit Music Ministry of Jesuit Communications Foundation, a ministry of the Philippine Province of the Society of Jesus, based in Ateneo de Manila University [^1^]. The group works closely with other Jesuit composers and musicians such as Fr. Arnel Aquino SJ, Fr. Jboy Gonzales SJ, Fr. Charlie Cenzon SJ, Himig Heswita, Hangad, and Vespers.
 
Bukas Palad Music Ministry has performed in over a hundred solo concerts across the country and overseas in Japan, Hong Kong, the United States, and Canada [^1^]. They have also participated in various liturgical events and music festivals such as the World Youth Day, the National Eucharistic Congress, the Philippine Papal Visit, and the Jesuit Music Festival. The group has also received several awards and recognitions for their contributions to Filipino music and culture, such as the Catholic Mass Media Awards, the Awit Awards, and the Aliw Awards.
